<h2>About me</h2>
<p> My name is Jack Allen, and I'm an 18 year from Columbia, Missouri.  My hobbies include swimming, video games, 
watching sports, fishing, camping, and just being  outdoors. I am a programmer, but I'm also learning basic web design 
(which I'm applying through building this website).  I'm always interested in learning new things and improving my skills
in these skill sets.</p>
<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>I started learning programming through the Columbia Area Career Center in 2014, with C++.  Through that, I learned
the basics of Object Oriented Programming, such as encapsulation, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.  Since then,
I've been exposed to other languages such as Java, PHP, Python, SQL, and Swift.  I've also participated in an internship
(and now employment) at a start-up company called QuarkWorks, based out of Columbia Mo, where I've learned iOS development. </p>
