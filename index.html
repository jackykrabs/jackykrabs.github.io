<h2>About me</h2>
<p> My name is Jack Allen, and I'm an 18 year from Columbia, Missouri.  My hobbies include swimming, video games, 
watching sports, fishing, camping, and just being  outdoors. I am a programmer, but I'm also learning basic web design 
(which I'm applying through building this website).  I'm always interested in learning new things and improving my skills
in these skill sets.</p>
