<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> Goose Hunt is an Android Game Application that I created, based off an incident that happened in real life, where a friend decided to shoot a nationally protected
bird, and get the conservation department called.  The idea of the game is to shoot (tap) on geese, while they
flock around the screen.  You collect points for every goose you tap.  However, if you tap on either of the people that pop up on the screen, bad things happen! 
You can also collect car keys to boost your score.</p>
<h2> Skill Application </h2>
<p> This project was basically used as a way to learn the basics of android development, and to play around with Android Studio.  Having learned a little bit of 
iOS development, I was interested in seeing how it compared to Android development, so I decided to make Goose Hunt.  This project covers concepts such as Java, using 
development software (Android Studio), subclassing developer made classes, and working with a nib.
